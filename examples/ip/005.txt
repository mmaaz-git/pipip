c Set-Covering Problem
c Sets:
c S1 = {1, 2, 3}
c S2 = {3, 4}
c S3 = {2, 5}
c S4 = {1, 4, 5}
c Each set has a binary variable x1, x2, x3, x4.
c x1 = 1 if S1 is chosen, x2 = 1 if S2 is chosen, and so on.

c Constraints:
c Each item must be covered at least once:
c Item 1: x1 + x4 >= 1
c Item 2: x1 + x3 >= 1
c Item 3: x1 + x2 >= 1
c Item 4: x2 + x4 >= 1
c Item 5: x3 + x4 >= 1
